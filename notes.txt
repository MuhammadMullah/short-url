What is Missing.

- Because of time and tight schedule. Trying to deliver on my current engagement,
  there are a few things that I left although my initial plan was to have them.
  
  1. I was intending to use the all time phoenix favourite feature. Phoenix LiveView.
     I had it configured but Because of time constraints couldn't use it.

  2. I also intended to style my app and make it more appealing using css and tailwind
     which I had also setup but I found it a bit challenging because of the learning curve
     and I thought I shouldn't waste time as for now what matters most is the functionality.


Improvements.

* Use of GenServers in place of Quantum for caching.
  - Although caching has been implemented(which is a very important factor when you think about)
    scalabilty of the app in realtime). I personally feel it can be improved and customized by taking
    advantage of GenServers
